# PlanMatrix

I got frustrated with searching healthcare.gov, so I coded this to make it super simple to download the general specs of all of the plans available to your zipcode, and dumped them into a spreadsheet for easy perusing.

Just change any requisite variables in the PlanMatrixVariables to the correct ones, and watch the magic work.
